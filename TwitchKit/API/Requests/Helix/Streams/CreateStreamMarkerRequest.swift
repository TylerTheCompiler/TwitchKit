/// Creates a marker in the stream of a user specified by user ID.
///
/// A marker is an arbitrary point in a stream that the broadcaster wants to mark; e.g., to easily return to later.
/// The marker is created at the current timestamp in the live broadcast when the request is processed. Markers can
/// be created by the stream owner or editors. The user creating the marker is identified by a Bearer token.
///
/// Markers cannot be created in some cases (an error will occur):
///
/// * If the specified userâ€™s stream is not live.
/// * If VOD (past broadcast) storage is not enabled for the stream.
/// * For premieres (live, first-viewing events that combine uploaded videos with live chat).
/// * For reruns (subsequent (not live) streaming of any past broadcast, including past premieres).
